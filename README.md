# accmath (Accelerated Math)
An Experimental Math Library with Accelerated Backends for Apple M1/M2 Processors.

This is mainly an experimental/education library playing with various accelerated math operations supported by Apple hardware.
I built this as a math abstration library to use in my realtime game physics engine which will be open-sourced when ready for beta.

Currently I am only supporting MacOS and Apple M1/M2 CPUs and GPUs, but may suppport other hardware and platforms in the future.

**WARNING: This is a work in progress**
